Your First Playthrough
***********************

Dark Souls III is not known for its user-friendly approach to learning the game. You begin by creating your character and then are abruptly shoved into the first boss fight of the game after a very short tutorial area. More information on starting the game can be found here.

FAQ
***********************

Where do I go after ____?

One of the most common questions new players have is where to go after beating the area they are currently in. Every area in Dark Souls III ends with a major boss fight. In most cases, after defeating the current boss, a pathway to the next area appears near the player. However sometimes that path is difficult to find, so for those cases, the Dark Souls III wiki is the easiest way to find out where to go next.

Is there any way to keep my souls when I die?

In Dark Souls III, souls are the currency as well as the way you level up your character and they are earned through defeating enemies. When you die, your souls are dropped on the ground near the location you died at and you must retrieve them before dying again or they are lost forever. There is an item called the Ring of Sacrifice that when worn will retain souls upon death, but it only has one use before breaking.


Bugs and Glitches
***********************

Sadly, the Dark Souls III wiki itself does not contain a dedicated bugs and glitches section, but the wiki forums and a detailed video containing all known bugs and glitches are good places to start.
